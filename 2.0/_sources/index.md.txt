# Analytical Network Simulator

Analytical network simulator models communications over multi-dimensional topologies through analytical equations. Currently, two variations of analytical network simulation are supported.
- congestion_unaware analytical network simulator
- congestion_aware analytical network simulator

This simulator is developed as a part of the ASTRA-sim project, thereby the analytical network simulator can naturally be used as the network modeling backend of the ASTRA-sim simulator. Please refer to [this page](https://astra-sim.github.io/astra-sim-docs/index.html) for detailed documentation of the ASTRA-sim.
